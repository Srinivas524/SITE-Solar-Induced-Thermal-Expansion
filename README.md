# SITE: Solar-Induced Thermal Expansion

## Defensive Publication  
This repository contains a **Defensive Publication** for the **Solar-Heated Rotating Wheel for Sound-Based Energy Generation**.  
This invention utilizes **solar-induced thermal expansion** to create **continuous motion**, striking a **bell or tuning fork** to generate **sound waves**, which are then converted into **electricity** using **piezoelectric materials**.
